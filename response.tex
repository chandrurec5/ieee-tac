Dear Editor,
We would like to re-submit the revised version of our paper. We would like to mention that we have not made major modifications in the current revision as we have not seen a clear way of further improving the current presentation and staying within the page limits. The main modification made, as per the suggestion of Reviewer1, is that we have re-written the experiments section. Besides this we have only made typographical modifications in other sections. Finally, we also thank the reviewers for their comments.
