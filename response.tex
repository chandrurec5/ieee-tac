Dear Editor,
We would like to re-submit the revised version of our paper. We thank the reviewers for their comments. We have made the following changes in the current manuscript:
1) While it was not entirely clear to us what could be done in simplifying the presentation in the main body of the paper, we however have proofread the whole paper and corrected typos that we found.
2) We have now rewritten the experiments section and improved the writing and explanations there.
We also added a new competing strategy, which we think is a strong baseline: The competing strategy uses the idealized
(but infeasible) distribution suggested in previous work. We found that the performance of this strategy is similar to that of the previous strategy that we compared to.
We wish to thank the reviewers for their useful comments.
