Dear Editor,
We would like to re-submit the revised version of our paper. We thank the reviewers for their comments. We have made the following changes in the current manuscript:
1) While it was not entirely clear to us what could be done in simplifying the presentation in the main body of the paper, we however have proof read
the whole paper and corrected typos that were there in the previous version. 
2) We have now rewritten the experiments section and improved the writing and explanations there.
We wish to thank the reviewers for their useful comments.
