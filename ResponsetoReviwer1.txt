Reviewer Comment: "The work is, as I said previously, good as it gives a nice theoretical
analysis. The introduction is a pretty nice review and a succinct summary of this line of work in MDPs."

Our Response: We thank the reviewer for the positive comments.

Reviewer Comment: "Nevertheless, the writing of the main body is still difficult to
follow. The authors may further work on simplifying the manuscript presentation. 
Though they have explained almost all the assumption in intuitive way
now, so I am satisfied with the authors response."

Our Response: From the comments, we are not clear what we should do further. We have also proof read
the whole paper and corrected typos that were there in the previous version.

Reviewer Comment: "Though I do not think that the experiments in the paper represent a
main part of the contribution, this section seems weak with respect to
the rest of the contribution and the setup could be explained  in a
better way."

Our Response: We have now rewritten the experiments section and improved the writing and explanations there.

Reviewer Comment: "I think the paper is ready with minor modifications."

Our Response: Thank you for your positive comments.
